# DDK_scheduler
* Just think about how to make a scheduler in the OS. 
* Well, because my major is scheduler in the OS, and actually if we know the binary code, it is easy just copy a part of binary code to the kernal space and execuate.
* Give this task(process) a peroid of execution time and caculate the utilaztion.
* store some information of the first task and chage(context switch) to the second task and execute it.
* Loop it quickly, and it looks like we execute two tasks in the same time.
